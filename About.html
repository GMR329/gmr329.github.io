		<h2>Profile</h2>

		<p>Welcome! My name is Gareth, I have a degree in computer science, and I make lil robots and gizmos in my free time. I enjoy most facets of computer science but I particularly enjoy robotics. To be able to create something physical and control it to interact with the world is basically a superpower, and I greatly admire the problems that are being solved and innovation in the field. 

<br><br>This website was designed to showcase many of the projects that I have had a great time creating and working on. It is currently a static website that gives a simplistic overview of what I’m working on and the gizmos I’ve created. One day it may evolve into something more detailed that others can follow and reproduce, but for now it allows me to share what I love doing and hopefully inspire others. 

<br><br>P.S. I am not a web developer and have little desire to become one. This website is a project in and of itself as it was programmed by hand in HTML and CSS with a little JavaScript for flavor. I apologize for any bugs, typos, or poor UX and I hope to constantly evolve this method of presentation. </p>
