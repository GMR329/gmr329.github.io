		<h2>The Project:</h2>
		<p>It was starting to feel like everybody cool had a robotic arm and I was beginning to feel left out. So, like Hephaestus forging his automatons, I sat down in my swivel chair with my chicken nuggies and got to work. I designed the entire arm in Solidworks, printing test fit pieces as I went. I then wired in the 5 servo motors, only 2 of which actually worked (unbeknownst to me at the time)! It then took me a few days to program a simple control scheme and iron out the servo jitter and power distribution (the robot uses a bench power supply to ensure a steady ~6 volts). </p>
		<p>While bug eradication and ensuring stable systems communication absolutely took up a fair amount of time, I’m proud to say there were no catastrophic failures (no fires, broken parts, or excessive tears shed) apart from the 3 kaput motors (which were definitely like that when I found them). Now the world is at my 2 plastic robotic fingertips, and I’m ready to take on any task provided it’s within about 8 inches of the base of the arm, and I have several orders of magnitude more time to waste on said task. I hope to keep iterating on this project and see what it can do! </p>

		<h2>At a Glance:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Designed arm in Solidworks and printed with personal 3D printer</li>
			<li>Utilized Python to implement a client/server model to communicate from controller to arm</li>
			<li>Used pyxboxcontroller library to take input from controller</li>
			<li>Used socket programming to send information to Raspberry Pi 4</li>
			<li>Used gpiozero and pigpio to signal servo motors to move based on input </li>
		</ul>
