		<h2>The Project:</h2>
		<p>I found an old Popular Mechanics book with a great many projects for young kids. I immediately felt awful about myself after reading (again, in a book targeted towards those half my age) about all the plans for wind powered snow sleds and motorized rafts that I won’t be able to make in my wildest dreams (just kidding, the second I have money, full send). I did find instructions (as good as 40 year old instructions can be) on how to make a toy motor with a nail, a tin can, and some enamel wire. I ended up cutting out a slice of 1/8th inch sheet metal for my arm, and made a neat little wood base. I found some magnet/enamel wire on Amazon and did my best. It doesn’t work at all like it’s supposed to, but it was able to magnetize and was a fun project to see a motor work at its most basic and to construct one from scratch. I hope to continue exploring motors and winding my own, and maybe even make one work one day. </p>
		<p>-December 2025</p>
		<p>PS: Those burn marks are not from me being wire dumb (though I am) but are from when I burned off enamel cover from the wires, and thought burning the wood too would look cool... I swear!</p>

		<h2>At a Glance:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Built wooden base out of tree round and wood</li>
			<li>Filed nail and attached arm to act as rotating axle</li>
			<li>Bent metal “u” and wound enamel wire to serve as electromagnet </li>
			<li>Successfully powered system with external power supply </li>
			<li>System was put together properly but was too imprecise preventing full spinning </li>
		</ul>
