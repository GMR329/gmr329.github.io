		<h2>The Project:</h2>
		<p>I started playing so much Minesweeper recently that I was seeing squares with numbers in them when I blinked. I figured I would try to be a little productive by playing a version that I created. It didn’t take long to write this version and it is indeed fully playable. It makes a grid of purple squares at the command line and the user types in coordinates to reveal the square they want which may reveal empty adjacent squares. This made testing with a 50 by 50 grid an absolute pain. To mark a potential mine, the user negates the coordinates where they think the mine is and it gets marked (but if there’s a mine at (0, 0), maybe just make a mental note of it…). This version makes for horrible UX, but it was a fun recreation of my current phone addiction. </p>
