		<h2>The Project:</h2>
		<p>Polka Dot (or Grow Circle) is a simple game where the player controls a dot that eats smaller dots to grow while avoiding larger ones. This game has been the perfect opportunity to practice with the Bevy game engine and ECS structure (OOP and I were on a break). Aside from the most beautiful UI and game menu known to man, this game made for more great practice with other common game interactions including working with mouse position, collision detection, and game state control.</p>
		<p>I found and played a game very similar to this one many years ago and don’t remember its name or where I found it (please don’t sue me). After failing to find the game recently, and really wanting to give it another go, I decided to make it myself and use it as an opportunity to further explore Rust and Bevy.</p>

		<h2>At a Glance:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Used Rust language to implement desktop game</li>
			<li>Used Bevy game engine in Rust to structure game features</li>
			<li>Used entity component system (ECS) coding paradigm </li>
			<li>Used Rapier physics engine to implement velocity and collision detection</li>
		</ul>
