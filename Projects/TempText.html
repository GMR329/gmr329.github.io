		<h2>The Project:</h2>
		<p>For some months I’ve been looking at my weather app thinking “I can make a far worse version of this, easily.” When I finally put together a home lab with a travel router and a couple of Raspberry Pis, I was at last able to. I realized I was looking at multiple different weather apps and had to sift through ads and information I didn’t care about to find what I was interested in. I decided I would prefer to text myself exactly what I wanted by creating a Rust app that runs on a Raspberry Pi. I’m using the Lettre crate to send an email to my phone number that has been constructed from a request of the OpenWeatherMap API for my cities of interest. I then email myself a few times a day every few hours. I can also configure in the code on what days I want certain locations so I don’t get irrelevant data. </p>

		<h2>At a Glance:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Used Rust reqwest crate to get JSON information from OpenWeatherMap API</li>
			<li>Used serde and serde_json crates to handle returned data and find relevant entries to send</li>
			<li>Used credentials JSON file that is untracked by version control to step up project security</li>
			<li>Used lettre crate to send email to phone number to send data</li>
		</ul>
